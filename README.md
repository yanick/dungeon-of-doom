# Dungeon of Doom

Toy project to showcase [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and 
[ROT.js](https://ondras.github.io/rot.js/hp/).

## To get running

    $ npm install
    $ npx sveltekit dev


This "application" was meant mostly as an accessory 
for my talk. Consequently, the
commits of main are adding and showcasing features of ROT.js
one by one.
